Problem Statement : In a competitive business environment, the company faces significant challenges related to inventory management, 
shipment delays, and balancing supply with demand. These operational inefficiencies lead to increased storage costs, inconsistent delivery 
performance, and missed sales opportunities, which ultimately impact customer satisfaction and profitability.

This project aims to address these inefficiencies by leveraging advanced analytics and data-driven insights to streamline inventory management, 
improve shipment performance, and ensure optimal supply-demand balance. The goal is to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and provide 
a better customer experience.

Key Findings:
1.Field & Stream Sportsman 16 Gun Fire Safe and Perfect Fitness Perfect Rip Deck are consistently high performers, generating significant revenue 
and profit across multiple months. These products are key revenue drivers for the business.

2.Products like Lawn Mower and Web Camera exhibit strong sales in specific months, highlighting seasonal demand patterns. Niche products such as 
Team Golf Tennessee Volunteers Putter Grip have high profit margins despite lower overall sales.

3.Perfect Fitness Perfect Rip Deck has both the highest number of delayed orders (1,904) and a large number of early shipments (1,518), suggesting 
potential inconsistencies in shipping and logistics for this popular product.

4.Products like Perfect Fitness Perfect Rip Deck and Field & Stream Sportsman 16 Gun Fire Safe incur significant storage costs, making them expensive 
to manage despite their high sales.

5.Strength Training and Sporting Goods categories suffer from extremely long average delays (395 and 203 days, respectively), indicating major issues 
in their fulfillment processes.

6.Other categories, such as Music and Cardio Equipment, also experience considerable delays.

7.Products like Nike Menâ€™s Comfort 2 Slide and Perfect Fitness Perfect Rip Deck offer high profit margins, making them top contributors to overall 
profitability.
